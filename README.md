## Authentication & Roles

The application uses Firebase Authentication with multiple sign-in methods:

- Email/Password authentication
- Google OAuth
- GitHub OAuth

Users are automatically redirected to their appropriate dashboard based on their role (patient, doctor, or admin).

### Role Provisioning and Access Control

- New users who sign up or log in with Google are assigned the **Patient** role by default.
- **Doctor** accounts are manually provisioned in the database and cannot be self-registered.
- Only provisioned doctors can access the doctor dashboard and approve appointments.

### Demo Doctor Accounts

Use the following doctor accounts for QA and demos:

- `fahim@healthcare.com`
- `sakib@healthcare.com`
- `samia@healthcare.com`
- `labib@healthcare.com`

Password for all: `1234Aa`

> Note: These accounts are provisioned in the database. Regular users cannot become doctors unless manually added by an admin/developer.

## Key Components

- **Appointment Management**: View, reschedule, and cancel appointments
- **Prescription Access**: View prescriptions from completed appointments
- **Payment System**: Payment confirmation with toast notifications

### Doctor Dashboard

- **Request Management**: Approve or reject patient appointment requests

### Appointment Booking

- **Doctor Selection**: Browse available doctors with detailed profiles

### Appointment and Queue Flow

1. Patients can book an available time slot with a doctor.
2. Each time slot supports up to **4 patients maximum**.
3. Bookings remain pending until the doctor reviews them.
4. When a doctor approves an appointment, the patient is moved into the **active queue** for that session.
5. Doctors can write and attach **prescriptions** to completed appointments.
6. Patients can view their prescriptions in their **Patient Dashboard**.

```
PATIENT → Book slot (capacity ≤ 4) → Pending
              ↓ (Doctor approves)
          Queue position assigned → Visit/Complete → Prescription available
```
